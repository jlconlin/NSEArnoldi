\f0\fs22 \cf0 Responses for Reviewer 2 comments:\
1) I recommend publication with minor revisions. The manuscript is well written except the item 13).\
\
2) The methodology in this article would be more promising than the Wielandt's method application to the MC power method.\
\
The authors feel the same way.\
\
3) Does the computational time per iteration increase?\
The computational expense was not a focus of this paper and should be the topic of another paper or technical note.  In short, th\
\
4) Does the extension to 3D space require the assumption of separation of variables?\
Application of Arnoldi's method in 3D is beyond the scope of this paper and thus was not addressed.  \
\
5) In third line of I INTRODUCTION, the authors state, "The power method is a robust application of a Krylov subspace method." This sounds weird to me. I would agree if the authors state, "The Krylov subspace method can be implemented in the framework of the power method."\
\
The power method at least dates back to the largest eigenvalue calculation of covariance matrix in principal component analysis as seen in the article below.\
\
H. Hotelling, "Analysis of a complex of statistical variables into principal components," J. of Educational Psychology, 24, 417-441, 498-520 (1933).\
\
We provided 4 references to the power method.  None of them are the earliest mention of the power method, but all are early references of the power method used in Monte Carlo criticality applications.\
\
6) In most MC codes in distribution, the fission source distribution is normalized to a fixed value of the total weight of starter neutrons. The authors state differently immediately above Eq (8).\
\
There are a variety of ways of normalizing the fission source distribution.  One way is to maintain the total weight of starter neutrons the same.  We did the same in our implementation.  This was not explicitly stated as this is common among Monte Carlo codes.\
\
7) It is not clear how normalization is taken into account in Eqs (12) and (13).\
\
There is no normalization in Eqs. 12 and 13.\
\
8) In Eq (17), h(j, m) appears for j=1, ? , m. In Eq (18), h(m+1,m) appears. Eq (19) cannot be used to define h(m+1,m) because Eq (19) with j=m+1 needs v(m+1) which is defined in Eq (18) via h(m+1,m). The definition of h(m+1,m) should be presented before Eq (19).\
\
Thanks for the suggestion.  This was updated in the paper.\
\
9) Is h(m+1,m) the norm of v_tilde (m+1)?\
\
Thanks for the suggestion.  This was updated in the paper.\
\
10) Is Eq (17) with Eq (19) the Gram-Schmidt procedure for orthogonalization?\
\
Thanks for the suggestion.  This was updated in the paper.\
\
11) In third line below Eq (20), "the first lower subdiagonal is non-zero" would be better because "upper triangular" already implies the first upper subdiagonal is non-zero.\
\
The authors feel that the wording in the paper is easier to understand than what is suggested by the reviewer.\
\
12) In fifth line from bottom of page 6, it is not clear what is implied by " ? and thus is small ? ."\
\
The authors are unclear what the comment means.\
\
13) The authors refer the readers to reference 13 concerning the decrease of residual in Eq (25). Some explanation with formula is desired because NSE is an archival journal and reference 13 is a conference paper.\
\
This was addressed in the paper.}
